# 100 Days Of Code ver 2019 - Log

### Day 1: June 6, 2019

**Working on:** Setup Github repository(just this repository today) in the VS Code with some shell commands in the terminal.

**Today's Progress:** Same as above.

**Thoughts:** I'm rebooting my 100 days of code journey with small steps. Slowly.
