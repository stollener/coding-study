**Issue**

My commit log to GitHub is not shown with my profile avatar and name properly.

**How to solve**

Email config needed to set locally.
[GitHub Help page]("https://forum.freecodecamp.org/clicks/track?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.github.com%2Farticles%2Fsetting-your-commit-email-address-in-git%2F&post_id=449300&topic_id=202302")
 helped me to solve the issue.
