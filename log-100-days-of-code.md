# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 6, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning by solving problem. Now solving calculating how many days exist between two dates.

**Thoughts:** It's more complex than I thought. But no problem to solve anyway.

### Day 2: May 7, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Finish coding "calculating days between dates". 

**Thoughts:** It was good for understanding small but essential structure of coding.

### Day 3: May 8, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning basic data structure, which is list. Difference between mutable and immutable.

**Thoughts:** I have a basic knowledge of computer science and coding, but difference between mutable and immutable data structure was interesting enough.

### Day 4: May 9, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learning to use for loop with list data. And now get back to web crawler thing (using list to store the url list).

**Thoughts:** I think this online course is great combination of lecture and 'do it by yourself'. More of lecture type, but still good for beginners.

### Day 5: May 10, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Coding problems related to crawling urls.

**Thoughts:** I'm stuck in the problem of crawling under max depth restriction. There's a "View Answer" button right under the question, but I'll think deep until tomorrow for waiting good idea coming out of my head.

### Day 6: May 11, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Finish crawling module. Problem sets about checking validation of sudoku, symmetric square, etc.

**Thoughts:** It's not easy to find a solution for each problem set. But it's worth time, and interesting to do.

### Day 7: May 12, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Learn about data structure and internet protocol(very basic level). Improve web crawler to have lookup procedure and index to search the url by keyword. Solve various problem sets.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm still cannot think like computer (computational thinking). Coding(solving the problems) are interesting, and I hope it's a small but steady step to be a programmer.

### Day 8: May 13, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** In CS101, learned to make hash table and function for better indexing of data. It improves lookup function much faster than simple list. And in SoloLearn, started to learn basic concepts.

**Thoughts:** It's quite impressive to see way faster lookup using hash function. And actually I already had finished the SoloLearn tutorial months ago, but wanted to remind me of the grammar of Python.

### Day 9: May 14, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Solving many problem sets. - Dictionary exercises. Refactoring (make functions more organized). Memoization (make cache function for repeated calculation). Rotating the letters (using ord() and chr() function).

**Thoughts:** It's still interesting to learn new things. For example, I heard a lot about refactoring from podcast or in the internet, but didn't know what it is. But now, I know basic concept of the term. I already imagine the day I code useful apps or websites.

### Day 10: May 15, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Learning about recursive procedures and PageRank method for best search result.

**Thoughts:** Straight 10 days of learning, I couldn't have done this before! I feel the power of 100 Days of Code project.

### Day 11: May 16, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Solved problem sets regarding recursive procedure.

**Thoughts:** Tough problems, but tried hard to solve them.

### Day 12: May 17, 2018

**Working on:** Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Learn Python grammar with SoloLearn app on the go.

**Thoughts:** Came home from work late at night, and had a no time to code at udacity course.

### Day 13: May 18, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Python 3 Tutorial (SoloLearn)

**Today's Progress:** Solved two problem sets (recursively making quick sort procedure), and some lessons about computer science history.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy that I already at 95% of the Udacity course. 100 Days of Code program really helps me.

### Day 14: May 20, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Watched final lectures about past and futures of computer science, and solved some cumulative practice problems.

**Thoughts:** As I skipped a day enjoying Seoul Jazz Festival, it's hard to come back to coding mind.

### Day 15: May 21, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity)

**Today's Progress:** Keep practicing final problems of CS101 @udacity.

**Thoughts:** One problem is difficult to solve, so I postponed it for tomorrow. I guess I can finish the course by tomorrow. Feel like I'm becoming lazy after I skipped a day. Have to more concentrate on the project.

### Day 16: May 22, 2018

**Working on:** Intro to Computer Science (Udacity) / Front End Development Certification (freeCodeCamp.org)

**Today's Progress:** Finished all the problem sets from CS101 at Udacity, but only a final problem remains. And started Front End Development Certification course at freeCodeCamp.org.

**Thoughts:** I'll keep the Udacity's problem unsolved for now. It's a little bit difficult problem, and I'll get back when I finish the freeCodeCamp's Front End course. I think it's more valuable for me to start freeCodeCamp course.

### Day 17: May 23, 2018

**Working on:** Front End Development Certification (freeCodeCamp.org)

**Today's Progress:** Finished "HTML and CSS" section of Front End Development Certification course. - ul, ol, input, form, button, div, class, id, padding, margin, hex code, ...

**Thoughts:** I've seen most of the tags before, but it's still meaningful to remind me of the basic grammar of html and css. And from tomorrow, I'll begin Bootstrap section, and then there will be jQuery and so on. I'm happy to study and code.

### Day 18: May 24, 2018
